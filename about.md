If past experience holds true I am currently writing for one hour and worrying about not writing the rest of my day.


I am a PhD student at University of Manchester working at the [Information Management Group](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/img/) (with [Prof. Carole goble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Goble)). My field of research is Research Data Repositories design, and in particular Open Data, which I study mostly with behavioural experiments, and to a lesser extent, case studies. You will find here informations related to my work, including my research (topics, papers, talks, projects, etc.), my teaching activities etc. My Resume is here: [CV][e5337b7d]
