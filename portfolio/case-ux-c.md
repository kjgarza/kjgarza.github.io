  heading: Crafting an Open-Science Analytics Dashboard for Bibliometricians

    Bibliometricians working in academic institutions often face challenges when needing to conduct quick analyses due to a lack of streamlined tools. The conventional method involving APIs and backend workflows can be time-consuming and requires specific technical know-how. This project aimed to develop a dashboard for bibliometricians, which would not only save them time but also provide a platform where their analyses could be hosted, thus promoting open science.

    To understand the needs and capabilities of our users, I conducted in-depth interviews with bibliometricians from different organizations. My questionnaire explored their technical capabilities and the data dimensions required for their work.
    I then analyzed the collected data using a strategic framework that categorized insights into dimensions, indicators, aggregations, computations, and filters. This methodology greatly informed my design of the visualizations.

    To capture a holistic view of the project, I also interviewed community stakeholders, funders, and the engineering team at DataCite. These interviews were pivotal in identifying the community's needs, defining the dashboard's success criteria, and understanding the feasibility in the context of DataCite's infrastructure.
    Subsequently, I created a medium-fidelity prototype in Figma, which was presented to ten experts during expert walkthroughs. This interactive approach allowed me to gain detailed insights and feedback to
    refine my design iteratively.

    content: 
          A parallel process for enriching metadata with subject classification was necessary due to the existing infrastructure limitations.

    headline: 02 Resourcing
    content: 
      The existing visualization tools at DataCite could address user needs, but significant backend development would be required for data processing.
  col_3:
    headline: 03 Success criteria
    content:  The dashboard's success would be gauged based on its ability to address at least one of the user stories within the stipulated time frame.

    My research and findings led me to recommend the following actions:
      1. Develop a workflow to enrich metadata with subject classification using client information as a proxy.
      2. Construct the dashboard using the current tech stack, but anticipate heavy backend alterations.
      3. Focus initially on user story 2, as the current system has ample data for useful visualizations.

    Our chosen framework for data analysis proved effective for designing the visualizations.
    These learnings will be invaluable in our future projects and continuous improvement of the dashboard.
