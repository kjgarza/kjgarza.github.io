    Currently, every single service for data usage processing requires using weblogs. Since weblogs are hard to share across distributed borders, there was a need to provide a different type of service. I set to define a service that could provide an alternative to the current state.

    Our team ran a [survey](https://zenodo.org/record/3476545#.YwOYF-xBxqt) with key stakeholders to identify the main challenges with the existing usage processing services and technical capabilities in the stakeholder groups. Based on the survey findings, I set up to define a web tracker as opposed to a usage processing service. That would reduce the main challenges the stakeholder groups had (time spent in processing and transferring logs)

    I validated the original idea using a productboard portal and opened it for discussion with our member community.

    During the Idea validation stage, I also collected more nuanced use cases that I used to create a detailed product specification using FIGMA for wireframing and Gherkin syntax for defining the acceptance criteria for engineering.

    I prepared and facilitated a Group Expert Walkthrough on the FIGMA wireframes to validate that the solution met the needs of the users and stakeholders. During this session, I collected additional information about user requirements.

  content: | 
    At the beginning of my design process I created wireframes for testing purposes.
    Guiding Questions
    - Why was it useful to do this?
    - What kind of wireframes did you make?
    - Low fidelity or high fidelity?
    - What tool did you use for this?
    - Did you use them for testing?
    - How many iterations did you have?

    - Being honest is a good thing, it means that you are aware of what you're doing.
