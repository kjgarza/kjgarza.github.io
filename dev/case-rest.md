    The High-level components I chose were as follows:
      - A REST API to support the CRUD operations.
      - A File Store for reports themselves.
      - A sql Store for the reports metadata, the user metadata and the individual metrics storage.
      - A queuing service to validate and process the reports.
      - A queueing service to process the reports metrics.
      - An Authenthication service for controlling the users permissions.
      - The reports must follow the COUNTER code of practice format
      
    In terms of deployment
      - I put a gateway service in front of everything.
      - And the API, Authenthication, and quein services are all deploy via containers.

    In terms of technology:
      - We selected Rails as framework for the all the services.
      - For the storage we use a combination: MySQL for persistent storage of the reports metadata, the user metadata, and the metrics; S3 for the file storage of the reports and Elasticsearch for storage of the metrics.
      - We use ElasticSearch for the storage of the metrics because it allows us to do quick aggregations and queries of the metrics independently of the report.
      - Deployment was done with AWS services. I use ECS for all the services and Mysql, S3 and OpenSearch to host the storage.

    - I also selected the jsonapi spec to deign the API. This way we can support very standard protocols and ways to manage the metadata deposits.
