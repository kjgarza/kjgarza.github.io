  content:  As an experienced Product Design Manager and Application Developer, I merge extensive knowledge of technology with a passion for design and service delivery. I have a proven track record in establishing DesignOps processes, leading teams, and developing applications, demonstrating proficiency in a broad range of tools and methodologies. Beyond my professional endeavours, I actively engage with the academic community, exploring the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for academic metadata schema mapping. I am deeply passionate about open science, data management, and the intersection of technology, design, and academia.
