    To catalyze researcher and bibliometrics interest and work in assessing data sharing and metrics, DataCite will build a bibliometrics dashboard that visualizes key fundamental bibliometrics indicators, which we will pilot on the more than 6 million datasets registered with DataCite.

    I conducted interviews with bibliometricians and stakeholders; the main challenge was aligning the goals and finding consensus on dashboard objectives. 

    A major challenge here was DataCite's infrastructure and data capabilities; I had to conciliate the infrastructure and data limitations with the user stories and goals we were aiming to address in the dashboard.

    Since it was difficult to find users to validate, I posted a conceptual idea of the dashboard in <a class="kglink" href="https://datacite.org/roadmap.html">DataCite Roadmap</a> (using ProductBoard). I requested visitors to provide feedback regarding their interest in the service and use cases. Nine organizations provided use cases during this idea validation.

    A technical walkthrough with experts was carried out to validate the prototype design. Here I used the same subject that provided use cases and support during the idea validation stage. 

    Overall the comments on the features were positive, but requests for additional visualization were made. To address this new input, I made the second round of interviewsâ€”this time laser-focused on visualization design. My questionary examined aspects such as dimensions, aggregations, filters, and measures to be included in the visualizations.
