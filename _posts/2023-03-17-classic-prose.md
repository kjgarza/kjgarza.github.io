# Title: Leveraging LLMs to Improve Academic Prose: Learning from Steven Pinker

Academic prose, despite its goal of disseminating knowledge, has often been criticized for being difficult to comprehend and laden with jargon. In his book ["A Sense of Style,"](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/310859/the-sense-of-style-by-steven-pinker/9780143127796/excerpt) Steven Pinker identifies several reasons for the poor quality of academic writing. By examining Pinker's critique and combining it with the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we can explore the potential for improving academic prose and making it more accessible to readers.

## Steven Pinker's Critique of Academic Writing

Pinker argues that academic writing is flawed due to two main reasons. First, academics tend to prioritize self-presentation over clear communication, striving to conform to the norms of their field and avoid appearing less knowledgeable than their peers. This self-consciousness leads to the use of jargon and complex syntax, which can make academic prose challenging to understand.

The second reason Pinker identifies is the "curse of knowledge," wherein scholars assume that their readers possess the same level of expertise as themselves. Consequently, they neglect to explain specialized terminology, clarify logical steps, or provide sufficient detail. This oversight results in prose that is incomprehensible to those who are not well-versed in the subject matter.

Using LLMs to Improve Academic Prose

Large language models, such as OpenAI's GPT series, are powerful tools for generating human-like text. By leveraging LLMs, we can address the issues Pinker raises and improve academic prose in the following ways:

- Simplification and clarification: LLMs can be trained to rewrite complex sentences into simpler and clearer versions, making the content more accessible to a wider audience. By breaking down jargon and convoluted syntax, LLMs can help bridge the knowledge gap between experts and non-experts.

- Explanation and elaboration: LLMs can assist in providing necessary explanations and elaborations where they are lacking in academic prose. By identifying areas where the "curse of knowledge" is at play, LLMs can generate additional information to make the content more comprehensible to readers with varying levels of expertise.

- Editing and proofreading: LLMs can serve as efficient editing and proofreading tools, identifying inconsistencies and errors in academic prose. By refining the writing and ensuring that it adheres to the principles of clarity and coherence, LLMs can contribute to producing high-quality academic prose.


## Intervention: Practical Application of LLMs to Improve Academic Writing

To demonstrate the potential of LLMs in enhancing academic prose, I selected three excerpts of challenging academic writing from a [1999 Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/dec/24/news). By employing [OpenAI's newest GPT4 model](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4), I rewrote these passages using classic prose style, as suggested by Steven Pinker.

Original Excerpt 1:
 > "The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence, and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure, and marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power." -- Butler, Judith (1997). Further reflections on conversations of our time. Diacritics 27 (1):13-15.

Rewritten Excerpt 1:
"As we journey from a structuralist viewpoint where capital shapes social interactions in fairly uniform ways, we arrive at the idea of hegemony, where power dynamics are constantly evolving through repetition and adaptation. This shift introduces the importance of time in our understanding of structures, leaving behind the rigid Althusserian approach focused on all-encompassing theoretical concepts. Instead, we open ourselves to the potential for change in structures, recognizing that hegemony is intricately connected to the ever-shifting landscape of power and its expression." -- GPT4

Original Excerpt 2:
> "If, for a while, the ruse of desire is calculable for the uses of discipline soon the repetition of guilt, justification, pseudo-scientific theories, superstition, spurious authorities, and classifications can be seen as the desperate effort to 'normalise' formally the disturbance of a discourse of splitting that violates the rational, enlightened claims of its enunciatory modality." -- Kerner, I. (2016). Homi K. Bhabha: The Location of Culture, Routledge: London/New York 1994, 285 S. (dt. Die Verortung der Kultur, Stauffenburg: Tübingen: 2000, 408 S.). In Klassiker der Sozialwissenschaften (pp. 392–395). Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-658-13213-2_91


Rewritten Excerpt 2:
"For a moment, we might believe that the trickery of desire can be harnessed for the purposes of control. Yet, it doesn't take long to realize that the recurring feelings of guilt, the justifications, the unfounded theories, superstitions, false authorities, and categorizations are all desperate attempts to impose a sense of normalcy on a fractured discourse that undermines the very essence of rational and enlightened thinking." -- GPT4

Original Excerpt 3:
> "As my story is an august tale of fathers and sons, real and imagined, the biography here will fitfully attend to the putative traces in Manet's work of 'les noms du père', a Lacanian romance of the errant paternal phallus ('Les Non-dupes errent'), a revised Freudian novella of the inferential dynamic of paternity which annihilates (and hence enculturates) through the deferred introduction of the third term of insemination the phenomenologically irreducible dyad of the mother and child." -- Armstrong, Carol, et al. Twelve Views of Manet’s Bar. Edited by Bradford R. Collins, vol. 1, Princeton University Press, 1996. JSTOR, https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv18zhd9c. Accessed 17 Mar. 2023.

Rewritten Excerpt 3:
"My story explores the profound relationships between fathers and sons, both real and imagined. In doing so, we will occasionally examine the potential influences of fatherhood in Manet's work through a Lacanian lens, which focuses on the elusive role of the paternal figure. We'll also revisit Freudian ideas about the complex dynamics of paternity, which serves to both destroy and shape culture by introducing a third element—fatherly influence—into the unbreakable bond between mother and child." -- GPT4


By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs and following Pinker's classic prose style suggestions, these rewritten excerpts are now more concise, accessible, and engaging for readers. This exercise showcases the potential of LLMs in improving academic prose, making it more approachable and comprehensible to a wider audience.

Steven Pinker's critique of academic writing highlights the need for improved clarity and accessibility in scholarly communication. By incorporating Pinker's suggestions and employing the capabilities of large language models, we can work towards enhancing the quality of academic prose, making it more comprehensible and engaging for readers. In doing so, we can promote the exchange of ideas and knowledge across disciplines and foster a more inclusive academic environment.


## Resistance from Academic Publishers: Addressing Concerns and Emphasizing the Benefits of LLMs

Despite the demonstrated potential of LLMs in improving academic prose, some academic publishers have expressed concerns about the use of AI and LLMs in scholarly writing. Fearing the potential loss of human input and originality, these publishers have moved towards banning AI-generated content in academic publications.

Counterarguments: Embracing LLMs as Complementary Tools

It is essential to acknowledge that while LLMs can be highly beneficial, they should not replace human intellect and creativity. Instead, they should serve as complementary tools to enhance the quality of academic writing. The following points argue against an outright ban on AI and LLMs in academic writing:

Collaborative approach: The use of LLMs in academic writing does not necessitate the replacement of human authors. Instead, they can work alongside scholars, providing assistance in refining complex prose, identifying gaps in explanations, and detecting errors. This collaborative approach ensures that human intellect and creativity remain at the core of academic writing, while benefiting from the strengths of AI.

Increased accessibility: As demonstrated in the previous section, LLMs can significantly improve the clarity and comprehensibility of academic prose. By adopting classic prose style and simplifying jargon, LLMs can make scholarly content more accessible to a broader audience, including students, policymakers, and the public. This increased accessibility is crucial for disseminating knowledge and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration.

Time-saving and efficiency: LLMs can save scholars time and effort by streamlining the editing and proofreading process. By automating these tasks, LLMs enable researchers to focus on more critical aspects of their work, such as developing novel ideas and conducting in-depth analysis.

Conclusion

Instead of banning AI and LLMs from academic writing, publishers should consider their potential benefits and adopt a collaborative approach that combines the best of human creativity and AI capabilities. By leveraging LLMs as complementary tools, academic writing can become more accessible, engaging, and efficient, ultimately contributing to a more inclusive and diverse scholarly landscape.
