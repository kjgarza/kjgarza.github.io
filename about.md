If past experience holds true I am currently writing for one hour and worrying about not writing the rest of my day.


I am a PhD student at University of Manchester working at the Information Management Group. My field of research is Research Data Repositories design, and in particular Open Data, which I study mostly with behavioural experiments, and to a lesser extent, case studies. You will find here informations related to my work, including my research (topics, papers, talks, projects, etc.), my teaching activities etc.
