    In terms of technology:
      - We selected Rails as framework for the all the services.
      - For the storage we use a combination: MySQL for persistent storage of the reports metadata, the user metadata, and the metrics; S3 for the file storage of the reports and Elasticsearch for storage of the metrics.
      - We use ElasticSearch for the storage of the metrics because it allows us to do quick aggregations and queries of the metrics independently of the report.
      - Deployment was done with AWS services. I use ECS for all the services and Mysql, S3 and OpenSearch to host the storage.

    - I also selected the jsonapi spec to deign the API. This way we can support very standard protocols and ways to manage the metadata deposits.
