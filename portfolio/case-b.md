    For this project, I worked as a senior Product Designer to define a new service that could provide an alternative to existing usage processing services that rely on weblogs. These weblogs can be difficult to share across distributed borders, so there was a need for a different type of service

    Our team ran a   <a class="kglink" href="https://zenodo.org/record/3476545#.YwOYF-xBxqt">survey</a> with key stakeholders to identify the main challenges with the existing usage processing services and technical capabilities in the stakeholder groups. Based on the survey findings, I set up to define a web tracker as opposed to a usage processing service. That would reduce the main challenges the stakeholder groups had (time spent in processing and transferring logs)

    I validated the original idea using <a class="kglink" href="https://datacite.org/roadmap.html">DataCite Roadmap</a> (using ProductBoard) and opened it for discussion with our member community.

    During the Idea validation stage, I also collected more nuanced use cases that I used to create a detailed product specification using FIGMA for wireframing and Gherkin syntax for defining the acceptance criteria for engineering.

    I prepared and facilitated a Group Expert Walkthrough on the FIGMA wireframes to validate that the solution met the needs of the users and stakeholders. During this session, I collected additional information about user requirements.
