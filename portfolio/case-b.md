    In this project, I took on the role of a Senior Product Designer to pioneer an alternative to existing data usage processing services. These services were heavily dependent on weblogs, which posed challenges when sharing across distributed borders, thus the necessity for a novel solution was clear.

    To kick off the project, we conducted a  <a class="kglink" href="https://zenodo.org/record/3476545#.YwOYF-xBxqt">survey</a> with key stakeholders to ascertain the primary difficulties associated with current usage processing services, as well as to gauge the technical capabilities within the stakeholder groups. Informed by the survey insights, we made the strategic decision to focus on developing a web tracker, which promised to alleviate stakeholders' challenges, particularly the time-consuming process of handling and transferring logs.

    The initial idea for the web tracker was presented on the <a class="kglink" href="https://datacite.org/roadmap.html">DataCite Roadmap</a> via ProductBoard. This provided a platform for our member community to discuss and provide feedback on the proposed concept.

    In tandem with the idea validation, we gathered detailed use cases which informed the creation of a comprehensive product specification. I employed FIGMA for wireframing and Gherkin syntax for defining clear acceptance criteria, ensuring a smooth handover to the engineering team.

    To ensure that our design solution effectively addressed user and stakeholder needs, I organised and facilitated a Group Expert Walkthrough on the FIGMA wireframes. This session yielded valuable insights into user requirements, further refining our approach.
