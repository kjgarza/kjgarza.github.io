    For this project, I worked as a senior Product Designer with experience in UX research methodologies, including design sprints. The goal of the project was to re-frame DataCite's harvesting services to better meet the needs of users.

    In preparation for the design sprint, I ran a focus group with potential users whose goal was to explore preferred ways of accessing harvesting services.

    After the Focus Group, I prepared a design sprint for the service. I chose a design sprint as the re-framing of the service was large enough to require a complete rethinking of the service from different perspectives. 

    For the Design Sprint agenda, I  chose to swap the order of the Map and long-term goal activities to help the team to picture the long before drawing the Map. I also ran the full Design Sprint remotely, as this was done during the pandemic.

    The interviews involved members of staff (n=7) that provided expert information in strategy and member support and the development team who gave feedback about the current state of harvesting services. 

    I defined a questionnaire I used during the interviews, and all the participants took How-Might-We notes. And I led the participants through the "Long-Term goal" and sprint questions activities. As well as introduce them to dot voting.

    Since it was difficult to find users to validate, I posted a conceptual idea of the dashboard in <a class="kglink" href="https://datacite.org/roadmap.html">DataCite Roadmap</a>  (using ProductBoard). I requested visitors to provide feedback regarding their interest in the service and use cases. Nine organizations provided use cases during this idea validation.

    Allowed the participants to work on the sketch individually and bring them together to do the heatmap voting and solution presentation. Some sketches were quite abstract, and I allowed time for questioning and further explanation. 
    
    Two sketches gather a significant amount of votes; hence rather than choosing only one, we consent to use both to generate a prototype.

    To clarify the pieces, you need to prototype, I helped the team through a user test flow exercise. That helped me to explain the required pieces to prototype.

    Then I prepared the prototype, which consisted of **low-fidelity wireframes**.

    For the Validation, I facilitated a secondary session inviting the Focus group participants to validate a wireframe prototype of the service and provided feedback. 

    Overall the design prototype got excellent comments and addressed the large majority of the needs of the users.

    When we were involved in the design sprint for the DataCite harvesting service, the "How Might We" question technique supported creativity while focusing on the problem to solve for the user.
