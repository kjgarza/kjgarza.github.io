    Academic research output is rapidly growing, making metadata management and connectivity more complex. Researchers previously had to navigate multiple platforms like DataCite, Crossref, ORCID, and ROR to gather metadata, which was inefficient. These platforms use different formats and lack a unified system. To address this, a GraphQL API is proposed as a solution. The API acts as a bridge between the disparate sources and users, enabling seamless access to relevant metadata from a single point. This streamlines metadata access to empower researchers and boost research quality and productivity.

    In summary, the exponential growth of academic research has created metadata management and integration challenges across diverse sources. A GraphQL API has been presented that can act as a unified platform to efficiently collect, organize, and connect relevant metadata. This API solution aims to support academic research and collaboration by overcoming previous inefficiencies.
